**Software and Program Design**

*Design Approach and Skills*

My approach to software design is centered on modularity and starting with a clear, high-level goal. For this project, the primary goal was to create a "visually appealing and realistic representation of a backyard oasis". This theme guided all subsequent design choices, from the main objects like the pool and hot tub to complementary elements like the stone patio and lighting.

The design process I followed was layered:

Structural Design: I began with foundational elements, building the ground plane first and then adding the major objects that define the space.

Detailing and Refinement: I focused on achieving realism through the careful selection of textures and materials, considering how each surface should interact with light to appear natural.

Atmospheric Design: I strategically placed multiple light sources—an ambient directional light and two localized point lights—to create a specific mood and highlight focal points.

Through this project, I crafted new skills in abstraction and modular design. A key tactic was encapsulating complex or repetitive operations into simple, reusable custom functions.


*Development Approach and Strategies*

My development approach is iterative. I start by building the basic structure of the scene and then iteratively add layers of detail and functionality. A core strategy is to prioritize efficiency, such as using primitive mesh shapes like boxes and cylinders because they are computationally efficient and can be combined to create more complex forms.

A new development strategy I used was creating a declarative rendering loop. By using helper functions such as SetShaderTexture and SetShaderMaterial, the main rendering code became less about low-level commands and more like a descriptive list of instructions: set an object's transformations, apply its texture and material, and then draw it.

Iteration was essential, especially for achieving realism. I applied textures and materials and then refined their properties, such as giving the water a high shininess value to make it look reflective. The placement of lights was also an iterative process of adjusting their position and intensity to create the desired ambiance. Throughout the project, my approach evolved from simply implementing features to engineering a well-organized and maintainable codebase, which was key to managing the scene's complexity.

*Computer Science and Future Goals*

Computer science, particularly computational graphics, provides the tools to transform a creative vision into a tangible, interactive digital experience. This project demonstrates how CS principles can be used to build realistic virtual environments, a skill set with broad applications.

For a future educational pathway, the knowledge gained here is foundational for advanced studies in:

Game Development and Design: The principles of 3D modeling, texturing, lighting, and camera control are central to creating interactive game worlds.

Scientific and Data Visualization: The ability to represent data and concepts visually is a powerful tool in research and analysis.

Simulation and Virtual Reality (VR/AR): Creating immersive and realistic scenes is the core of VR and simulation applications.

Software Architecture: The emphasis on writing modular, reusable, and efficient code is a critical skill in any advanced computer science curriculum.

For a future professional pathway, these skills are directly applicable to numerous industries.
